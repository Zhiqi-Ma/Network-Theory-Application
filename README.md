# Network Theory with Application

The goal of this class (Math 168 at UCLA during Winter 2024) is to introduce networks as mathematical models for diverse real-world phenomena. We covered important mathematical definitions needed for this modeling, the statistical description of real and synthetic networks, construction of networks with desired statistics. The course culminates with a study of how network structure affects the spread of diseases.

We built a team-based final project in the end: we focus on exploring music similarity in guitar songs using network theory. 

It analyzes chord progressions by constructing chord networks from selected songs and employing various methods like eigenvalue centrality, earth moverâ€™s distance, and matrix multiplication for similarity comparison. Furthermore, the project delves into generating chord sequences through Markov chain-based random walks, influenced by the patterns in the analyzed data.
